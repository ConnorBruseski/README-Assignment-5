1. The Wikipedia Page that I used to create my clean_csv was the list of countries and depedencies by population
2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_and_dependencies_by_population
3. The tables I selected included Location, Population, percent of the world, date source and notes. So i took the dataset from wikipedia and basically used it all.
4. Some cleaning steps I applied to my dataset was making column headers shorter without citation footnotes, replacing the citation markers and removing data cells and finally dropping all na values so incomplete columns and rows were no big deal.
5. Some limitations I had were the packages I had to import, some of them were not working but I realized I needed to install them on Anaconda.
